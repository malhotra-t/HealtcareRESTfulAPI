# Insurance Portal â€“ (RESTful Web Service/CQRS Architecture)

Implemented a RESTful web service API using Spring Boot for defining a schema (json-schema.org) and then creating entities against it for CRUD operations in an Insurance Portal. Performed JSON schema validation on business model entities and did real time updates to ElasticSearch to support Lucene query syntax.
